# Drought Prediction Using Meteorological Data on SAS EM

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a robust drought prediction model using meteorological data. SAS Enterprise Miner (SAS EM) was utilized for data clustering and testing various predictive models such as Decision Trees, Regression, and Neural Networks. The goal was to achieve the least misclassification rate, with results visualized through Tableau for clear insights and effective communication.

## Key Features
- **Data Clustering:** Leveraged SAS EM to cluster meteorological data and identify meaningful patterns related to drought.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Evaluated multiple models, including Decision Trees, Regression, and Neural Networks, to determine the most accurate approach.
- **Performance Optimization:** Achieved a misclassification rate as low as 8% through rigorous testing and model refinement.
- **Data Visualization:** Used Tableau to create interactive dashboards and visualizations for better understanding of the data trends and model outcomes.

## Tools and Technologies
- **SAS Enterprise Miner (SAS EM):** For clustering, model building, and performance evaluation.
- **Tableau:** For creating interactive visualizations and presenting data insights.
- **Predictive Models:** Decision Trees, Regression, and Neural Networks.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. **Data Preparation:** Import meteorological data into SAS EM and preprocess it for clustering and modeling.
2. **Clustering:** Use clustering techniques in SAS EM to identify patterns and segment data.
3. **Model Testing:** Apply Decision Trees, Regression, and Neural Networks to the data.
4. **Optimization:** Evaluate the models to minimize the misclassification rate and select the best-performing model.
5. **Visualization:** Export results and use Tableau to visualize data trends and model outcomes.

## Results
- Reduced the misclassification rate to **8%**.
- Developed a reliable model for drought prediction.
- Created intuitive Tableau dashboards for better understanding and presentation of insights.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effective use of SAS EM and Tableau for building a data-driven drought prediction system. The approach can be extended to other use cases requiring predictive modeling and data visualization.
